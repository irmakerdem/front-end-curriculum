## Iteration 1 - Winning Game
The functionality for when a user guesses the correct word is incomplete. Currently, the letters turn green and a message logs to the console. Update the codebase so the following happens when a user guesses the correct word:
- A message appears on the screen letting the user know they have won.
- A message appears on the screen letting the user know how many guesses it took them to win.
- The messages disappear after 4 seconds.
- The game board clears of all previous guesses.
- The focus is put back on the top left square of the game board (as it does on page load).
- The key on the left side of the screen resets.
- You should not force a page reload to make this happen.

## Iteration 2 - GET Words
Currently, the words are coming from the `words.js` file. Update the codebase so that you are fetching that data. You should be able to delete `words.js` after this iteration without the user experience being affected. Information on the endpoint is below.
