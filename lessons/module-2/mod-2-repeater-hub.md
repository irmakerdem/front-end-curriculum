Welcome! Please read this entire page completely. Reach out to your instructors if you have any questions!

## Repeating Guidelines
General information about repeating can be found [here](https://frontend.turing.edu/documents/repeat_guidelines_student_2020.pdf)

## Slack Channels
Make sure you are part of the following channels:
* **#mod_2_fe_repeaters**: The main channel for mod1 repeaters. Instructors will post announcements here so it's important to check this channel daily.
* **#the_repeaters**: A community of Turing students and alumni who have repeated or are currently repeating a module.

## Gear Ups and Professional Development  
**PD expectations for repeating Mod 2:**  
You will be added to a new Homeroom group and are expected to attend Homeroom discussions and Mix It Up on Wednesdays.  You are not required to attend the other PD sessions.  
Repeating the module is a great opportunity not only to solidify your technical skills but also your professional development skills. [This plan](https://careerdev.turing.edu/module_two/m2_pd_repeat_plan) goes over some suggested ways to approach that.  @allison_reu_singer is always available for support and coaching at the link in her Slack bio. You can reach out to her with any questions you have.  

**Gear Up expectations for repeating mod 1:**  
You are expected to attend all Gear Up sessions, except for Week 1 which is optional for repeaters.   

## FAQs

**Q:** *Should I delete my jsFun and start over?*  
**A:** Yes! You should delete your old  repo and then clone down a new one and start over. It's important that you approach these problems with a clean slate. Plus, we may have updated the repo since last inning.  

**Q:** *Should I complete jsFun over and over?*  
**A:** No! You should only complete each test **once** this inning. 
We recommend starting on [jsFunner](https://github.com/turingschool-examples/jsFunner) first. If you finish that, you can go back to a fresh copy of jsFun and begin anew.
We find that when students complete the same test suite more than 2 times, memorization and pattern matching kick in (which is not what we want!). These test suites should be improving your problem solving skills. If you feel yourself being able to write code without reading the full test, it's probably time for a new test suite.  

**Q:** *Should I reference my old projects when working on projects this inning?*  
**A:** This is not a good idea. Remember, the projects are about learning, not completion. We'd rather you productively struggle through the logic on a project than just look back at how you did it last time and copy the answer. Also, this approach isn't fair to your project partner(s) who is seeing this stuff for the first time. We know it's tempting, but remember **it's about process over product**.  

**Q:** *Should I get a head start on projects?*  
**A:** You should not be working on projects before they are officially kicked off. There is plenty for you to work on if you finish a project early (hint: the **Extra Practice** section!). Projects are meant to be completed in the time allotted. Also, instructors make changes to project specs leading up to the kickoff. Finally, one goal of group/paired projects is collaborative learning and communication and that is sacrificed when students work ahead on these projects.
