### Solo Reflection

Consider the following questions about your group project from mod 2.
- What about that project sticks out to you the most?
- What was the most memorable moment from that project?
- What is something you did well during that project?
- What is something you wish you had done better?

Now, think about the themes from the questions in the previous activity. Which theme do you think you could speak to best using that group project from mod 2 as your tangible example?

### Mini Mock Interview

In pairs, you'll practice answering one question by using that group project from mod 2.

- Determine who is person A and person B.
- Person A will tell person B what theme/category they'd like to focus on.
- Person B will then choose a question from that category and ask person A.
- Person A will answer that question and use the project experience to anchor their answer.
- Person B will give feedback on their answer.
- Switch roles and repeat!

You will have 20 minutes total, so be sure to watch the clock and switch roles after 10 minutes.
