### Note

React Router just released the newest version - `version 6`. This lesson has been updated to reflect the changes for v6. If you're looking for the v5 lesson, go [here](https://frontend.turing.edu/lessons/module-3/react-router-v6.html). Interested in upgrading your v5 app to v6? Start [here](https://reactrouter.com/docs/en/v6/upgrading/v5).
</section>

## Learning Goals:
* Understand and articulate the need for routing
* Be able to confidently implement React Router in a project
* Utilize URL params to build dynamic routes

## Vocab
* `BrowserRouter` A \<Router\> that uses the HTML5 history API (pushState, replaceState and the popstate event) to keep your UI in sync with the URL
* `Router` The class that \<BrowserRouter\> is extended from
* `Link` Links provide declarative, accessible navigation around your application
* `NavLink` A special version of the \<Link\> that will add styling attributes to the rendered element when it matches the current URL.
* `Route` Its most basic responsibility is to render some UI when a location matches the routeâ€™s path
* `Routes` A component that wraps your Route components that selects the best path match
* `useParams` A hook that allows us to gain access to a Route's params

## React Router

<section class="call-to-action">
### Prework Review
In small groups, discuss the following questions:
1. Why use Router?
2. Describe the high-level process of setting up Router in a project (packages to install, basic component needed)
3. Describe the following components:
- Route
- Routes
- Link
- NavLink
- Outlet
</section>

### Why Routing?

**Routing** refers to keeping a webpage up to date with the current url, and vice-versa.

Most of the apps you've written so far have been single-page applications. One HTML page whose content is updated through user interactions and JS. These DO NOT use routing. They work fine, but put some limits on the user experience of our applications.

Here  are some advantages routing can provide:
- Users can use urls to bookmark pages
- Users can use the back or forward button
- Users can easily share content from a page in the app

If you have written a multi-page application, you may have wrestled with Webpack configs in order to get all your pages built successfully. Fortunately, routing with React is easy! We just need to use a library called <a href="https://reactrouter.com/docs/en/v6" target="_blank">React Router</a>.

**React Router allows us to conditionally render components based on the current url**

### The Code

Rather than tell you about how Router works, we'll work through a series of exercises and examples.

We'll be using <a href="https://github.com/turingschool-examples/react-router-v6" target="_blank">this repo</a> to solve a series of challenges listed below.

**Installation Instructions**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/turingschool-examples/react-router-v6
cd react-router-v6
npm i
npm start

# open your text editor
```

The App is not fully put together. It has a series of components that will serve as building blocks of the final component. You won't be building out new components, but you will be editing existing ones.

### Setting up Router

Before we break out into groups, we'll review how to set up Router as a class.

<section class="call-to-action">
### Look through the codebase
Get oriented with the application. Check out all the components, try and write a short summary of what each is doing.
</section>

The `<Home />` component is rendering a welcome message. Right now, nothing but a nav bar is being rendered by the App. Let's use router to render the `<Home />` component as a landing page.

Remember that React Router conditionally renders components based on the current url. So our goal is to **render the <Home /> component when the user is at the base url**.

<section class="call-to-action">
### Setting up Router

To use React Router, we need to wrap any components that will use a React Router-provided-component in some kind of [Router component](https://reacttraining.com/react-router/web/guides/primary-components/routers).

We'll use a [Browser Router](https://reacttraining.com/react-router/web/api/BrowserRouter), since our app will be used in the browser. This Router provides access to the [HTML5 History API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/History_API). But we won't worry about those details just yet.

<section class="answer">
### The first step is installing react router:
```bash
npm install react-router-dom
```
</section>

<section class="answer">
### Once you have React Router installed, import your chosen Router:

```jsx
// index.js

import React from 'react';
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom';
import './index.css';
import App from './App/App';
import { BrowserRouter } from 'react-router-dom';

const router = <BrowserRouter> <App /> </BrowserRouter>;

ReactDOM.render(router, document.getElementById('root'));
```
</section>

<section class="answer">
### Now, add a Route for the `Home` component into your `App`:

```jsx
// App.js

import React, { Component } from 'react';
import './App.css';
import puppies from '../data/puppy-data.js';
import sharks from '../data/shark-data.js';
import Creatures from '../Creatures/Creatures';
import Home from '../Home/Home';
import { Routes, Route } from 'react-router-dom';

export default class App extends Component {
  render() {
    return (
      <main className="App">
        <nav>
          <a href="/puppies" className="nav">Puppies</a>
          <a href="/sharks" className="nav">Sharks</a>
        </nav>
        <h1>Puppies or Sharks?</h1>
        <Routes>
          <Route path="/" element={ <Home /> }/>
        </Routes>
      </main>
    );
  }
}

```
We picked `/` for the path in the route because it designates that there won't be anything after the URL's domain name. This represents the base url.  

</section>

<section class="answer">
### Finally, let's update those `a` elements to `NavLink` components:

```jsx
// App.js

import React, { Component } from 'react';
import './App.css';
import puppies from '../data/puppy-data.js';
import sharks from '../data/shark-data.js';
import Creatures from '../Creatures/Creatures';
import Home from '../Home/Home';
import { Routes, Route, NavLink } from 'react-router-dom';

export default class App extends Component {
  render() {
    return (
      <main className="App">
        <nav>
          <NavLink to="/puppies" className="nav">Puppies</NavLink>
          <NavLink to="/sharks" className="nav">Sharks</NavLink>
        </nav>
        <h1>Puppies or Sharks?</h1>
        <Routes>
          <Route path="/" element={ <Home /> }/>
          <Route path="/puppies" element={ <Creatures name="puppies" data={puppies} /> }/>
          <Route path="/sharks" element={ <Creatures name="sharks" data={sharks} /> }/>
        </Routes>
      </main>
    );
  }
}

```
</section>

<section class="call-to-action">
### Let's break things!

1. What happens if you remove the line that starts with `import { Routes...`? What does the error message say?
2. What happens if you remove the `Routes` component? What does the error message say?
3. Change the `<NavLink />` components to `<Link />` components. What happens?

## Exercise # 1: Render Puppies

Your goal is click on the word Puppies and see a grid of 9 puppies on the DOM. The page should look something like the picture on the lesson plan. ***While you may change components*** as needed, you shouldn't outright delete content from the page to achieve this.

<section class="call-to-action">
### Take 10 minutes in pairs to get the puppies rendering

<section class="note">
### Hints:
- Use the Creatures component. Formatting and styling is handled for you.
- What additional react-router components should you use? Do any current components need to change?
- How do you pass props into a component rendered by a `<Route />` ?
</section>

<section class="answer">
### Solution

```jsx
// App.js

import React, { Component } from 'react';
import './App.css';
import puppies from '../data/puppy-data.js';
import sharks from '../data/shark-data.js';
import Creatures from '../Creatures/Creatures';
import Home from '../Home/Home';
import { Routes, Route, NavLink } from 'react-router-dom';

export default class App extends Component {
  render() {
    return (
      <main className="App">
        <nav>
          <NavLink to="/puppies" className="nav">Puppies</NavLink>
          <NavLink to="/sharks" className="nav">Sharks</NavLink>
        </nav>
        <h1>Puppies or Sharks?</h1>
        <Routes>
          <Route path="/" element={ <Home /> }/>
          <Route path="/puppies" element={ <Creatures name="puppies" data={puppies} /> }/>
        </Routes>
      </main>
    );
  }
}
```
</section>

<section class="call-to-action">
### Let's reflect!

1. Why doesn't the `<Home />` component render when you're on the `/puppies` path?
2. Does order matter? Try switching the two `<Route />` components. What happens?
</section>

</section>

## Exercise # 2: Rendering Sharks

<section class="call-to-action">
### Take 6 minutes to independently get the sharks link working as well!

<section class="answer">
### Solution

```jsx
// App.js

import React, { Component } from 'react';
import './App.css';
import puppies from '../data/puppy-data.js';
import sharks from '../data/shark-data.js';
import Creatures from '../Creatures/Creatures';
import Home from '../Home/Home';
import { Routes, Route, NavLink } from 'react-router-dom';

export default class App extends Component {
  render() {
    return (
      <main className="App">
        <nav>
          <NavLink to="/puppies" className="nav">Puppies</NavLink>
          <NavLink to="/sharks" className="nav">Sharks</NavLink>
        </nav>
        <h1>Puppies or Sharks?</h1>
        <Routes>
          <Route path="/" element={ <Home /> }/>
          <Route path="/puppies" element={ <Creatures name="puppies" data={puppies} /> }/>
          <Route path="/sharks" element={ <Creatures name="sharks" data={sharks} /> }/>
        </Routes>
      </main>
    );
  }
}
```
</section>

<section class="call-to-action">
### Let's think!

Hmmm...two of those `<Route />` components are looking quite similar. I wonder if there is a way to make that more dynamic. Take a minute to consider what would we need in order to turn those two `<Route />` components into one.

### Route Params

<section class="call-to-action">
Router has a handy way to deal with dynamic paths...

<section class="answer">
### Let's start by making a dynamic path:

```jsx
// App.js

import React, { Component } from 'react';
import './App.css';
import puppies from '../data/puppy-data.js';
import sharks from '../data/shark-data.js';
import Creatures from '../Creatures/Creatures';
import Home from '../Home/Home';
import { Routes, Route, NavLink } from 'react-router-dom';

export default class App extends Component {
  render() {
    return (
      <main className="App">
        <nav>
          <NavLink to="/puppies" className="nav">Puppies</NavLink>
          <NavLink to="/sharks" className="nav">Sharks</NavLink>
        </nav>
        <h1>Puppies or Sharks?</h1>
        <Routes>
          <Route path="/" element={ <Home /> }/>
          <Route path="/:animal" element={ <Creatures name="puppies" data={puppies} /> }/>
        </Routes>
      </main>
    );
  }
}
```
</section>

<section class="call-to-action">
### Let's reflect!

In your app, click on the `Sharks` button. What renders to the page? What shows up in the URL? Why?
</section>

So now we need the `<Creatures />` component to know which animal we've selected.

<section class="answer">
### First, let's console.log some stuff:

```jsx
// Creatures.js

import React from 'react';
import './image-display.css';
import { useParams } from 'react-router-dom';

const Creatures = ({ data, name}) => {

  console.log(useParams());

  const creatureImages = data.map(creature => {
    const { id, image } = creature;
    return <img src={image} key={id} id={id} className="app-img"/>
  });

  return (
    <>
      <h1>{name}!</h1>
      {creatureImages}
    </>
  )

}

export default Creatures;
```
</section>

<section class="call-to-action">
### Let's explore!

1. What console.logged? Where does the key:value pair come from?
2. Click between the `Puppies` and `Sharks` buttons. How is the logged object changing?
3. Manually type something random into the URL, like `localhost:3000/potatoes`. What logs?
</section>

<section class="answer">
### Let's use useParams to render the correct animal:

```jsx
// Creatures.js

import React from 'react';
import './image-display.css';
import { useParams } from 'react-router-dom';
import puppies from '../data/puppy-data.js';
import sharks from '../data/shark-data.js';

const Creatures = () => {
  const data = useParams().animal === 'puppies' ? puppies : sharks;

  const creatureImages = data.map(creature => {
    const { id, image } = creature;
    return <img src={image} key={id} id={id} className="app-img"/>
  });

  return (
    <>
      <h1>{useParams().animal}!</h1>
      {creatureImages}
    </>
  )

}

export default Creatures;
```
</section>

<section class="answer">
### Notice that Creatures isn't using props anymore. Let's remove those from App.js:

```jsx
// App.js

import React, { Component } from 'react';
import './App.css';
import Creatures from '../Creatures/Creatures';
import Home from '../Home/Home';
import { Routes, Route, NavLink } from 'react-router-dom';

export default class App extends Component {
  render() {
    return (
      <main className="App">
        <nav>
          <NavLink to="/puppies" className="nav">Puppies</NavLink>
          <NavLink to="/sharks" className="nav">Sharks</NavLink>
        </nav>
        <h1>Puppies or Sharks?</h1>
        <Routes>
          <Route path="/" element={ <Home /> }/>
          <Route path="/:animal" element={ <Creatures /> }/>
        </Routes>
      </main>
    );
  }
}
```
</section>

</section>
---

## Exercise #3: Dynamic Routing

Take a look at the `<CreatureDetails />` Component. It displays all the animal's details on the page.

<section class="call-to-action">
### Your Task is to make a route that will dynamically render a CreatureDetails component for an animal based on its ID.

For example, the URL `/puppies/1` should render a view just for the puppy with an ID of 1 in the dataset, with all of its details (name, bio, etc).

<section class="note">
Hints:
- Use the CreatureDetails component
- What will you need to do to ensure that the URL is updated when you click on a given animal?
- How can you access the type of animal AND ID from the URL?
- How can you find a one animal's data in an array based on its id?
</section>

<section class="answer">
### Solution

It could look something like this (there is not one correct answer!):
```jsx
// CreatureDetails.js

import React from 'react';
import './image-display.css';
import { Link, useParams } from 'react-router-dom';
import puppies from '../data/puppy-data.js';
import sharks from '../data/shark-data.js';

const CreatureDetails = () => {
  const animalType = useParams().animal;
  const currentId = useParams().id;
  const data = animalType === 'puppies' ? puppies : sharks;
  const currentCreature = data.find(creature => {
    return creature.id === parseInt(currentId)
  })

  return (
    <div>
      <Link to={`/${animalType}`} className='back-btn'>â—€ back</Link>
      <h1>{currentCreature.name}</h1>
      <img src={currentCreature.image} className='app-img-no-hover'/>
      <p className='creature-bio'>{currentCreature.bio}</p>
    </div>
  )
}

export default CreatureDetails;


// App.js

...
<Route path="/:animal/:id" element={ <CreatureDetails /> }/>
...
```

// Creatures.js

...
  return (
    <Link to={`/${animal}/${id}`}>
      <img src={image} key={id} id={id} className="app-img"/>
    </Link>
  )
...
</section>

Another solution could have included passing the data as props from `App` to `Creatures` and `CreatureDetails`!
</section>

## Extra Resources:
It is likely that you'll run into use cases for the following router components. Feel free to take a peak at what they can do!
* `Outlet` A component that renders the next match in a set of matches.
* `Navigate`/`useNavigate` Helps you force a URL change. [This](https://gist.github.com/mjackson/b5748add2795ce7448a366ae8f8ae3bb) is a helpful resource!
